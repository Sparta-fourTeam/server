# Committing in this repository (conventional-pre-commit)

This repository enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
via the `conventional-pre-commit` hook. If the hook rejects a commit, don't bypass the
format — fix only what the rejection message points at and recommit (see section 6).

## 1. This repo's agreed convention

Types in use: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `typo`, `test`

Scope is not enforced, but fill one in when it's reasonably clear. Suggested values
by layer:

- Spring/Java repo: `api`, `entity`, `service`, `config`, `security`
- Domain/feature scopes (once genre is settled) are fine too, and often read better in
  a CHANGELOG than layer names — e.g. `feat(shop): ...` over `feat(api): ...` for a
  user-facing change. Neither is required; use whichever helps a reader more.

Breaking changes: append `!` before the colon (`feat(api)!: ...`) and explain the
break in the description; a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is only needed for detail
beyond what the `!` + description already conveys.

## 2. Write the message

Format: `type(scope): description`

```
feat(shop): 상점 아이템 목록 조회 API 추가
fix(entity): 연관관계 매핑 오류 수정
chore(config): Checkstyle 규칙 추가
```

- Description in the language the team actually writes commits in (Korean is fine —
  Conventional Commits doesn't require English).
- No period at the end of the description.
- Body (if any): one blank line after the description, then free-form paragraphs.
- Footers (if any): one blank line after the body, `Token: value` or `Token #value`,
  e.g. `Refs: #123`.

## 3. Validate before committing

There's no non-interactive "dry run" flag on the hooks themselves — running a real
commit attempt is the check. Beyond the message format, several other hooks run at
commit time (formatting, secret scanning, lint). See
`references/pre-commit-hooks.md` for the full hook list, how each one behaves, and
commands to run them ahead of time.

If there are Java changes, Spotless and Checkstyle run against the whole build at
commit time and can be slow, so running the following ahead of time avoids any
rework at commit time (optional, not required):

```
./gradlew spotlessApply checkstyleMain checkstyleTest --quiet --build-cache
```

`gitleaks` only catches credentials that look like real keys — known token formats
or long, high-entropy strings. A short literal such as `password: 1234` in
`application*.yaml` passes it. Before committing config changes, check the staged
diff for hardcoded passwords/secrets yourself and write them as
`${ENV_VAR:local-default}` (e.g. `password: ${DB_PASSWORD:1234}`) so real values
come from the environment. Test-only config under `src/test/resources` may keep
obvious dummy values.

## 4. Add missing Javadoc before committing

Checkstyle (`MissingJavadocType`, `MissingJavadocMethod`, `maxWarnings = 0`) blocks
the commit when Javadoc is missing, and it only reports after a slow full-build run.
So check the staged diff yourself before committing and add Javadoc wherever the
rules below require it — treat it like a compiler error: always fix it, don't ask
whether to. Write the Javadoc in Korean (`docs/conventions.md`: 한글 Javadoc).

Required on:

- Every public/protected class, interface, enum, record, and annotation type
  (except `@SpringBootApplication` / `@Generated`).
- Public/protected methods and constructors whose body is 2+ lines, inside a
  public type.

Not required (same carve-outs as `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`):

- Members annotated `@Override`, `@Test`, or `@GetMapping`/`@PostMapping`/
  `@PutMapping`/`@PatchMapping`/`@DeleteMapping`/`@RequestMapping`.
- Repository-style methods: `findBy*`, `findAll*`, `findById*`, `save*`, `delete*`,
  `deleteBy*`, `existsBy*`, `countBy*`, `getById*`.
- Simple getters/setters, one-line methods, and members of non-public types.

Format rules that Checkstyle also enforces once Javadoc exists:

- The first sentence is the summary and **must end with a period**, even in
  Korean: `/** 사용자 정보를 조회한다. */`, not `/** 사용자 정보 조회 */`.
- Every `@param`/`@return`/`@throws` tag needs a description, tags come in that
  order, and an empty line separates them from the description. `@param` and
  `@return` themselves are optional.
- A multi-paragraph body puts `<p>` directly before the first word of each new
  paragraph (not on its own line).

## 5. Split unrelated changes before committing

A commit should represent one kind of change. Before writing a commit message,
check what's actually staged (`git diff --staged`, or `git status` if nothing is
staged yet). If the changes mix things that belong to different types or scopes —
e.g. a new endpoint plus an unrelated typo fix plus a `.gitignore` tweak — split
them into separate commits rather than writing one message that tries to cover
everything.

How to split:

1. Unstage everything if it's already staged in one lump: `git restore --staged .`
2. Stage one logical group at a time. Use `git add <specific files>` when whole
   files map cleanly to one change, or `git add -p` to interactively pick hunks
   within a file when a single file mixes unrelated edits.
3. Commit that group with its own conventional message.
4. Repeat for the next group until everything committed is intentional.

**Splitting criterion**: the core test is whether this commit alone can be safely
reverted. A `feat` commit's own supporting changes (e.g. the entity plus the
repository plus the service method it needs) are one logical unit — reverting them
separately would break the build, so don't fragment changes that depend on each
other this way. Conversely, split changes that can be reverted independently of
one another.

If asked to just "commit this" and the staged/working changes clearly mix
unrelated concerns, propose the split (which files/hunks go where, with what
message) before running any `git commit` — don't silently pick one and commit
everything under it.

**Respect existing staging state.** If files are already staged (`git diff
--staged` is non-empty) when asked to commit, ask a plain scope question
*before* doing any diff analysis of your own:

> Staged: `<list the staged files>`. Commit just these, or should I also look at
> the unstaged/untracked changes?

Don't skip this by silently deciding for yourself whether the staged set "looks
coherent enough" — that judgment call belongs to the user, not to you jumping
straight into a mixed-concerns analysis or a per-file splitting proposal. Ask
this scope question first, unconditionally, whenever staged content already
exists; only after the user answers it do you move on to checking whether the
resulting scope mixes concerns (section 5 above) or is branch-unrelated (below).

**Branch-unrelated changes are a separate question from grouping.** If a change
touches a file/area that doesn't match what the current branch name or PR is
about (e.g. an unrelated `common/` class showing up on a `feat/user-service-logic`
branch), the first question is whether to commit it at all right now — not how to
group it with everything else. Ask that as its own explicit question, with an
"exclude for now" option alongside any "include" options, for example:

- Commit it now (bundled with the related changes, or as its own separate commit
  on this branch)
- Leave it uncommitted / move it to its own branch, and only commit what actually
  belongs to this branch's purpose

Don't collapse this into a "how do you want it grouped" question that assumes
inclusion — offering only bundling variants silently forecloses the "don't
commit this here at all" option the user needed to see.

## 6. Self-correct when a hook rejects

Several hooks run together, so the response depends on the kind of rejection —
auto-fix hooks (whitespace/EOF/Spotless) just need a restage and recommit, blocking
hooks (merge conflicts/large files/secrets/Checkstyle/message format) need the
underlying cause fixed by hand (see `references/pre-commit-hooks.md` for the
breakdown). For `conventional-pre-commit`, the rejection output names the problem
plainly, e.g.:

```
Conventional Commit......................................................Failed
[Bad Commit message] >> add a new feature

Your commit message does not follow Conventional Commits formatting
...
Conventional Commits start with one of the below types, followed by a colon...
```

- Fix only what the error/rejection flags (missing type, disallowed scope, wrong
  format, a detected secret, etc.) — don't rewrite unrelated parts.
- Restage (auto-fix hooks) or fix the cause (blocking hooks), then retry the commit.
- NEVER use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass any hook — fixing the problem is
  always the correct action, and bypassing defeats the whole point of enforcing
  this for the team.
